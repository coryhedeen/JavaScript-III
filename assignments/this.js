/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window: in the global scope, "this" will reference, or bind to, the window.
* 2. Implicit Binding: In the local scope, "this" will refer to the object in which it is contained.
* 3. New Binding: A constructor object creates a template in which "this" refers to the object. Consequently, "this" will refer to any object formed from this template.
* 4. Explicit Binding: When the function is called, "this" is manually set to the object of choice.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
